2. Query to Identify the Countries with the Lowest CO2 Emissions in the Dataset


SELECT 
    Country, 
    CO2_Emissions
FROM 
    country_pollution
ORDER BY 
    CO2_Emissions ASC
LIMIT 1;
This query will return the country with the lowest CO2 emissions.

3. Query to Find All Temperature Records Above a Specific Value (e.g., 20°C)


SELECT 
    Country, 
    Temperature, 
    Date
FROM 
    country_pollution
WHERE 
    Temperature > 20;
This query lists all records where the temperature is above 20°C.

4. Query to List All Countries with CO2 Emissions Data Available for the Year 2020
