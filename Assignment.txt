1. Write SQL statement select to display customer Full Name in one column, their City and Amount of
sales. We need data only for customers whose mother has brown eyes.

A) SELECT 
    CONCAT(c.FirstName, ' ', c.LastName) AS FullName, 
    a.City, 
    s.Amount
FROM 
    Sales s
    JOIN Customer c ON s.CustomerID = c.Id
    JOIN Customer m ON c.MotherIDNumber = m.IDNumber
    JOIN Address a ON s.CityID = a.ID
WHERE 
    m.EyeColor = 'Brown';


2. Write SQL statement select to display First Name and Last Name of users which ordered 3 and more
courses. Use tables from below.

SELECT 
    u.FirstName, 
    u.LastName
FROM 
    [Order] o
    JOIN User u ON o.UserID = u.ID
GROUP BY 
    u.FirstName, 
    u.LastName
HAVING 
    COUNT(o.CourseID) >= 3;


3. What will be the result of the select below


ELECT  
    SUM(p.Amount) AS Amount 
FROM  
    Payments p 
    INNER JOIN Clients c ON p.ClientId = c.Id 
    INNER JOIN Address a ON c.Id = a.ClientId 
WHERE  
    c.Name LIKE '%iro';


1. Tuple in Python and Difference Between List and Tuple
Tuple: A tuple is a collection of objects that is ordered and immutable. Tuples are defined using parentheses ().

Difference:

Lists are mutable, meaning they can be modified after creation (e.g., elements can be added or removed).
Tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their elements cannot be changed.

2. Rules for Local and Global Variables in Python

Local Variable: A variable declared inside a function is a local variable and is accessible only within that function.
Global Variable: A variable declared outside any function is a global variable and is accessible throughout the entire program, across all functions.

3. Python's Parameter Passing Mechanism
Mechanism: Python uses a mechanism called "Pass-by-Object-Reference."

4. Method to Open a Text File and Display Its Content
python

def display_file_content(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        print(content)

5. Python Syntax to Achieve Specific Dictionary Outputs
To get {'key2': ['Vishesh', 'For', 'Python'], 'key1': [1, 2]}:

python

strList = ["Vishesh", "For", "Python"]
valList = [1, 2]
result = {'key2': strList, 'key1': valList}
To get {'key1': [1, 2, ['Vishesh', 'For', 'Python']]}:

python

strList = ["Vishesh", "For", "Python"]
valList = [1, 2, strList]
result = {'key1': valList}
To get {'1': [1, 2], '3': [3, 4], '2': [2, 3]} using list comprehension:

python

valList = [1, 2, 3]
result = {str(i): [i, i+1] for i in valList}
